# 🔧 TypeScript Errors Fixed

## ✅ Issues Resolved

### 1. **Missing Dependencies Added**
Added the following missing dependencies to `frontend/package.json`:

```json
{
  "@react-spring/three": "^9.7.3",
  "@use-gesture/react": "^10.2.27"
}
```

### 2. **Import Path Corrections**
Fixed import paths in test files that were still referencing the old directory structure:

- `test-knowledge-graph.js`: Updated import path from `./sovren-executive-command-center/` to `./frontend/`
- `test-administrative-monitoring.js`: Updated import paths from `./sovren-executive-command-center/` to `./frontend/`

### 3. **Workspace Structure Verified**
All required files exist in the correct locations:
- ✅ `frontend/src/types/index.ts` - Exports `ApprovalRequest` type
- ✅ `frontend/src/providers/CommandCenterProvider.tsx` - Exports `useCommandCenter` hook
- ✅ `frontend/src/hooks/useAppStore.ts` - Exports `useAppDispatch` and `useAppSelector`
- ✅ `frontend/src/utils/particleEffects.ts` - Exports `ParticleEffectsManager`

## 🚀 Next Steps

### 1. **Install Dependencies**
Run the setup script to install all dependencies:

```bash
node setup-workspace.js
```

Or manually install dependencies:

```bash
# Install root dependencies
npm install

# Install frontend dependencies
cd frontend && npm install

# Install shared dependencies
cd ../shared && npm install
```

### 2. **Build Shared Package**
```bash
cd shared && npm run build
```

### 3. **Verify TypeScript Compilation**
```bash
cd frontend && npx tsc --noEmit
```

### 4. **Start Development**
```bash
# Start both frontend and backend
npm run dev

# Or start individually
npm run dev:frontend
npm run dev:backend
```

## 🎯 Expected Result

After running the setup script and installing dependencies, all TypeScript errors should be resolved and you should be able to:

- ✅ Compile TypeScript without errors
- ✅ Start the development servers
- ✅ View the 3D approval queue visualization
- ✅ Use all React Three Fiber components
- ✅ Access all shared types and utilities

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

If you still see TypeScript errors after installing dependencies:

1. **Clear node_modules and reinstall**:
   ```bash
   rm -rf node_modules frontend/node_modules shared/node_modules
   npm install
   cd frontend && npm install
   cd ../shared && npm install
   ```

2. **Restart TypeScript server**:
   - In VS Code: `Ctrl+Shift+P` → "TypeScript: Restart TS Server"

3. **Check TypeScript version**:
   ```bash
   npx tsc --version
   ```

4. **Verify file paths**:
   - Ensure all files are in the correct `frontend/` directory structure
   - Check that import paths are relative to the file location
