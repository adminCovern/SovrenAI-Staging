# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The SOVREN AI Executive Command Center frontend requires a complete redesign to transform from a basic dashboard with simple cards into an immersive, holographic command bridge experience. This system will integrate 8 AI executives with real-world business systems including email, calendar, CRM, and voice communications, creating a unified command center where users feel like they're commanding the bridge of the Starship Enterprise for business operations.

The redesigned frontend must provide real-time visualization of executive activities, seamless integration with external business systems, and an authorization framework that maintains user control while enabling autonomous executive operations. The system will serve as the primary interface for users to monitor, direct, and approve their AI executive team's activities across all business functions.
